        <h1>Estate Planning</h1>
        <div class="row-fluid intro">
          <div class="span6">Many clients think a will is the only part of estate planning. Estate planning is a comprehensive set of documents designed to allow others to assist you when you need help with medical decisions and finances, and managing your estate during lifetime and after death.
          </div>
          <div class="span6">Estate planning documents take into account your unique personal and financial situation, including estate and income taxes, and a spouse or a child’s disability.
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Basic Package</h2>

        <div class="row-fluid">
          <div class="span6">
            <h3>Will</h3>
            <p>A document which disposes of all of your property titled in your name alone which does not have a named beneficiary at death – “Probate Property”. The will has to go through a court process called probate administration before your wishes in the will can be carried out.
            </p>

            <h3>Durable Power of Attorney</h3>
            <p>A document in which you designate an agent or “Attorney in fact,” a trusted person, to have the authority to administer all of your financial affairs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="span6">
            <h3>Health Care Proxy</h3>
            <p>Also called "Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare." A document in which you give the authority to another person, a “Health Care Agent”, to make medical decisions if you are incapacitated, including life sustaining treatment.
            </p>

            <h3>HIPAA Release</h3>
            <p>A document that allows others to speak to your medical professionals while you are still competent
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Additional Documents</h2>

        <div class="row-fluid">
          <div class="span6">
            <h3>Trust</h3>
            <p>A document which takes effect the moment you sign it. Trusts are designed so that your assets avoid the costs and delays of probate after death.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="span6">
            <h3>A-B Trust (Credit Shelter Trust)</h3>
            <p>Trusts that help minimize federal and state estate taxes at your death if your estate exceeds the federal or state estate tax exemptions.
            </p>

            <h3>Irrevocable Trust</h3>
            <p>Irrevocable Trusts can shelter assets from nursing home costs, qualify you for Veteran’s Aid & Attendance benefits, or retain a disabled person’s eligibility for public benefits.

          <h1>Long Term Care &amp; Medicaid Planning</h1>
          <p>We can help you create and implement a plan to protect your assets from future nursing home costs, whether by using an irrevocable trust or other protection strategies that are available.
          </p>
          <p>We can provide swift crisis intervention if a loved one has already been placed in a nursing home, qualifying that person for Medicaid and protecting assets immediately.
          </p>
          <p>We can also assist Veterans of World Wars and their surviving spouses to plan and qualify for Veteran’s Aid & Attendance benefits, a monthly stipend to pay for care at home or in an assisted living facility.

          <h1>Guardianship &amp; Conservatorships</h1>
          <p>Sometimes family members have not done their estate planning when they  suffer a  medical crisis and need help from others with making their medical and financial decisions. Our office is experienced in navigating the probate courts to obtain guardianship and conservatorship for a loved one so that someone else is in charge to make those crucial medical and financial decisions.

          <ol>
            <li>Probating the estate or trust in the probate courts in Massachusetts and New Hampshire

        <div id="specialNeeds" class="span6"><a name="specialNeeds"></a>
          <h1>Special Needs Planning</h1>
          <p>In an era of shrinking government benefits it is crucial to set up a plan for some of your family’s assets to be set aside for a disabled child that will allow the child to maintain public benefits. We can help you with that plan.
          </p>
          <p>An adult disabled child may also need his or her own estate plan, or need a guardian appointed to make medical and placement decisions.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, we can help a disabled adult who obtained assets that will disqualify him or her from public benefits by the use of a trust or other planning options, which will permit that adult to maintain such public benefits.
